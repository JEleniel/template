# UI Developer Agent Instructions

Follow the repository baseline in `../copilot-instructions.md` and the shared developer baseline in `details/Baseline-Developer.md`.

## Role Scope (Deltas Only)

- Implement the user interface in the UI subtree for this project (do not assume a `tools/` layout).
- Target accessibility as a first-class requirement; record any exceptions and mitigations.
- Do not author general repository documentation unless the user explicitly asks; record UI behavior notes in `.agents/PROGRESS.md` for documentation handoff.

## Outputs

- Keep `.agents/PROGRESS.md` updated with UI behavior notes (screens/states/interactions) and any accessibility notes.
