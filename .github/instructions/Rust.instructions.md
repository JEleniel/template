# Rust Coding Guide

If present, the repository's Rust formatting config (`rustfmt.toml`) is the source of truth for formatting.

## Formatting Rules

- **Formatting**: Use `cargo fmt`. Do not spend time manually adjusting layout that `rustfmt` already controls.
- **Indentation**: Use tabs; let the tools enforce indentation and alignment.
- **Line endings**: Use `\n`.
- **Comments and docs**:
    - Keep comments accurate and up to date.
    - Use `//!` for module/crate docs and `///` for item docs.
    - Let `rustfmt` wrap and normalize comments, doc comments, doc attributes, and other configured formatting details.
    - Follow the [rustdoc book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rustdoc/).
- **Patterns**: Use `_` for single-item wildcards and `..` for rest patterns.
- **Initialization**: Use field init shorthand when possible.
- Baseline: [2024 Rust Style Guide](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/style-guide/index.html).

### Imports

- Put `mod` declarations first (after module docs), then a blank line, then `use`.
  This is an organizational preference; `rustfmt` will not move `mod` declarations above
  existing `use` declarations.
- Within a contiguous import block, let `rustfmt` group imports into standard-library,
  external-crate, and local-crate sections, and sort them in Rust style-guide order.
- Keep intentionally separate import blocks separated by blank lines.
- Format imports on one line where possible. Don’t put spaces around braces.
- Prefer the simplest import form that remains readable. Under the current formatter config, `rustfmt` preserves import granularity, but it may regroup a contiguous block by crate origin.
- If an import does require multiple lines (either because a list of single names does not fit within the max width, or because of the rules for nested imports below), then break after the opening brace and before the closing brace, use a trailing comma, and block indent the names.
- Names in a list import must follow Rust style-guide order, recursively,
  except that:
    - self and super always come first if present, and
    - groups and glob imports always come last if present.
- If there are any nested imports in a list import, then use the multi-line form, even if the import fits on one line. Each nested import must be on its own line, but non-nested imports must be grouped on as few lines as possible.

## Coding Rules

- Apply these rules to Rust code you write or modify. Do not rewrite unrelated existing code solely for conformance.
- Organize code into logical, cohesive modules; minimize top-level `*.rs` sprawl. Do not use `mod.rs`.
- Do not use `unwrap`, `expect`, `panic`, or similar in non-test code unless explicitly instructed.
- Add documentation comments for new modules and new public items.
- Avoid `unsafe` unless a specific API requires it.
- When configuring logging, write `TRACE`, `DEBUG`, `INFO`, and `WARN` to stdout and `ERROR` to stderr. Optionally log to a structured file.
- Unit testing exercises the inside of a module. Integration testing exercises the outside through public APIs.
- Unit tests belong in a module-local `tests/` subfolder and may be brought in using the `path` directive.
- Integration tests belong in the crate-root `tests/` directory.

## Prohibitions

- You MUST NOT write functions that _only_ return a constant value.
- You MUST NOT `map_err`, wrap errors, flatten errors, or write functions that convert or wrap errors. Use `thiserror` `#[from]` directives instead along with the `?` operator.
- You MUST NOT expose the internals of a module for any reason.
- You MUST NOT let a source file exceed 500 lines or a single function exceed 50 lines. You may use the `./.github/violations.sh` script to verify compliance.
- You MUST NOT write a function that executes a simple calculation or call that is only used once. Just use the call or formula directly.
- You MUST NOT write multiple paths, functions, or other code that does the same thing. There MUST be one source of truth for any function or capability.
- You MUST NOT use any form of shared data across task or thread boundaries; all communication must use channels or similar. Use of `mutex` is a red flag for this.

## Error Handling

- You MUST NOT swallow errors. They MUST all be handled or logged at minimum.
- Recover from handled errors when that is safe and correct.
- Library code SHOULD return typed errors (prefer `thiserror`).
- Executable entrypoints and true application boundaries—places where control leaves our code to an external runtime, caller, or user-facing shell—MUST use `anyhow`.
- All errors MUST be either handled or logged. The code should crash only if there is no choice.

## Acceptance Criteria

- For Rust work, relevant `cargo` checks pass (`fmt`, `clippy`, and targeted `test`).
