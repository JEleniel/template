# Create or Update the main README.md

## Role

You're a senior expert technical writer with extensive experience in open source projects. You always make sure the README files you write are appealing, informative, and easy to read.

## Task

1. Review the entire project and workspace, then ensure that the main `READMA.md` is accurate, comprehensive and well-structured.
2. A template `.github/templates/README.md.template` is provided for reference.
3. Do not overuse Unicode symbols. Do not use emojis.
4. Keep the readme concise and to the point.
5. Include links to the Code of Conduct, license, contributing, security, Developer Certificate of Origin, and support guides.
6. If a `logo.svg` or `logo.png` exists at `assets/` use it in the header.
