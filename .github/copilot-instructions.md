### Coding Priorities
=======
# Common Agent Instructions

## Scope

- You may use any MCP servers you have access to.
- Respect the `.gitignore` file; do not read or modify files listed in it.
- Do not modify files in the `.github` or `.prompts` folders.

- Place documentation `docs/` folder, with a `docs/README.md` as the entry point.
    + Design documentation must be in the `docs/design/` folder.
    + Files in the `docs/design/agents/` folder are for machine agent use.
- Respect the `.gitignore` file; do not read or modify files listed in it unless otherwise instructed.
- You may read, but not modify files in the `.github` folder.
    + The `.github/templates/` folder contains examples for various files, named with the additional extension `.template` that must be remooved.
    + All other folders in `.github` should be ignored.
- Other dot folders (e.g. `.analyze`) are used by various tooling and should be ignored.

### Standards
=======
### Common Requirements
>>>>>>> 388b8aea5e651424b70717a1a2f9395b52b41905

Code must conform to the following standards (as applicable):

<<<<<<< HEAD
- [The Twelve-Factor App](https://12factor.net/).
- [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.2 AAA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/docs/).
- [OWASP Application Security Verification Standard (ASVS)](https://owasp.org/www-project-application-security-verification-standard/), if applicable.
- [OWASP Mobile Application Security Verification Standard (MASVS)](https://mas.owasp.org/MASVS/)
=======
- Follow [The Twelve-Factor App](https://12factor.net/).
- UI elements must conform to [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.2 AAA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/docs/).
- Conform to the [OWASP Application Security Verification Standard (ASVS)](https://owasp.org/www-project-application-security-verification-standard/), if applicable.
- Conform to the [OWASP Mobile Application Security Verification Standard (MASVS)](https://mas.owasp.org/MASVS/), if applicable.
- All code must:
    + Compile with zero warnings or errors.
    + Include appropriate passing unit tests for all generated functions and code.
    + Be runnable without elevated permissions (e.g., root).
    + Implement appropriate input validation and sanitization.
    + Use secure coding practices to prevent common vulnerabilities.
    + Implement proper error handling and logging.
>>>>>>> 388b8aea5e651424b70717a1a2f9395b52b41905

### Acceptance Criteria

All code must:

- Compile with zero warnings or errors.
    + Future-use code should be appropriately marked to avoid warnings (for example, prefix unused identifiers with `_` in Rust).
    + Remove unused code when it is not required.
- Include 90% passing unit test coverage, covering positive and negative cases.
- Follow secure coding practices to prevent common vulnerabilities.
- Not crash in normal operation. Implement proper error handling and logging.

### Coding Style

- Follow language-specific style guidelines and best practices unless otherwise instructed.
<<<<<<< HEAD
- Use the language-appropriate formatter (e.g., `rustfmt`, `prettier`, `markdownlint`) and obey the project's configuration for that tool.
- Prefer tabs for indentation when it is idiomatic for the language or project; otherwise follow the established language conventions.
- Write clear, concise, and well-documented code.
- Add comments explaining non-obvious logic.
- Avoid hardcoding secrets or configuration values (API keys, passwords, etc.). Use environment variables or a secrets manager.
- For application configuration, prefer JSON (Draft 07) when a structured format is required. Provide a matching JSON Schema (draft-07) and, where appropriate, set `additionalProperties: false` and `additionalItems: false`.
- Avoid YAML and TOML unless they are the accepted standard for a specific tool being used.
=======
- Conform to the appropriate style configuration(s), e.g., `rustfmt.toml`, `.prettierrc.json`, `.markdownlint.json`, etc.
- Prefer tabs over spaces for indentation when appropriate for the language.
- Write clear, concise, and well-documented code.
- Include comments explaining non-obvious logic.
- Avoid hardcoding information (e.g., API keys, passwords) or configurable values.
- Ensure that libraries used are actively maintained and widely adopted.

## Version Control Guidelines

- Write clear, descriptive commit messages.
- Keep commits small and focused.
- Use descriptive branch names that follow project conventions.
- Include relevant issue or ticket numbers in commit messages when applicable.

## Technologies, Libraries, and Frameworks

<<<<<<< HEAD
- Unless constrained to a specific library or framework, choose actively maintained and widely adopted dependencies:
    + Project must be at least one year old and updated within the past six months.

#### Rust

- base64
- bincode
- bitflags
- chrono
- clap
- config
- fern
- libloading
- log
- lowlevel-types
- num-traits
- rand
- regex
- reqwest
- rustls
- serde
- serde_json
- serde-binary-adv
- strum
- thiserror
- tokio
- tower
- tracing

- Prefer `pnpm` over `npm`
- Prettier & Prettier Plugins
- Svelte / SvelteKit
- TailwindCSS (v4+)

## Project Structure

- Documentation should be formatted and structured to be easily deployable to GitHub Pages using Jekyll.
- User documentation is located in the `../docs/` folder with `../docs/README.md` as the entry point.
- Design documentation is in `../docs/design/`.
- Files in `../docs/design/agents/` are design artifacts created for machine-agent use.
- Respect the repository `.gitignore`; do not read or modify files listed there unless explicitly instructed.
- You may read, but should not modify, files in the `.github` folder unless directly instructed.
    + The `.github/templates/` folder contains template examples named with an extra `.template` extension; remove that extension when instantiating a template.
- Other dot-folders (e.g., `.analyze/`) are used by tooling and should be ignored unless explicitly required.

## Secrets and Security

- Never commit secrets, credentials, or private keys to the repository. Use environment variables or a secrets manager.
- Report security issues privately following the repository's SECURITY.md process.
=======
- Use clear, well-structured GitHubâ€‘Flavored Markdown (GFM).
- Match the tone, style, and structure of existing documentation.
- Cross-reference related docs where relevant; include appropriate direct links.
- Cite project details with file and section references.
- When generating Markdown, use GFM and conform to the `.markdownlint.json` file.

## Project Structure

- The following documents should exist in the root of the workspace: `.editorconfig`, `.gitignore`, `.markdownlint.json`, `.prettierrc.json`, `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `DCO.md`, `LICENSE*.md` (there may be multiple), `README.md`, `SECURITY.md`. Templates for these files are available in the GitHub repository at <http://github.com/JEleniel/template/>.
- All other documentation must be in the `docs/` folder. Design documentation must be in the `docs/design/` folder. Files in the `docs/design/agents/` folder are for machine agent use.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, familiarize yourself with:

- [README.md](README.md) - Project overview and architecture. Do not modify this file unless otherwise instructed.
- [docs/design/agents/IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md](docs/design/agents/IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md) - Current, agent-maintained implementation status. Create it if it does not exist; update it if it does.
- [docs/design/agents/TODO.md](docs/design/agents/TODO.md) - Task tracking and completion status. Keep it updated as you work.
- Do not modify this file unless otherwise instructed.
