	"steps": [
		"Implement discovery probes for TCP/UDP/ICMP using randomized target ordering and scheduling parameters",
		"Add banner analysis and fingerprinting capabilities for HTTP, SSH, SMB, RDP, LDAP, and custom protocols",
		"Feed discovered services to the enumeration queue with policy-driven concurrency limits",
		"Integrate rate-limit, jitter, and random source-port behavior to prevent fingerprinting",
		"Test discovery coverage with lab targets and mock timing variability"

	"acceptance_criteria": [
		"Services across HTTP/SSH/SMB/RDP/LDAP are discovered with captured banners",
		"Discovery obeys randomization/jitter parameters and never emits deterministic probe sequences",
