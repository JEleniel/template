		"Define job schema capturing targets, policy, dependencies, and checkpoint cursor",

		"Implement worker pool clients that consume tasks over HTTP/2 TLS1.3, apply rate-limit/jitter, and report results",
		"Add resume logic so interrupted scans restart from checkpoints and fresh secrets invalidate prior sessions",
		"Write load/integration tests verifying massive scope distribution and checkpoint recovery"

		"Scheduler can allocate thousands of targets with checkpointed progress",
		"Workers obey rate limits/jitter and authenticate server-provided tasks",
