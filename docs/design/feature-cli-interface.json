	"steps": [
		"Define CLI commands (`hela scan`, `hela report`, `hela status`, `hela cancel`) that translate to the REST API over HTTP/2",
		"Expose policy selection flags (`--policy=default|complete|deep|fast`) plus configurable scan set selection (`--set=`) referencing feature-scan-sets",
		"Surface depth, detectability, target risk, and operator risk ratings in CLI prompts so users understand the impact of their selections",
		"Implement OAuth2 Client Credentials token acquisition via config files",
		"Wire CLI commands to call feature-rest-api endpoints and stream results",
		"Document CLI usage in README/docs and validate via integration tests"
	],
	"acceptance_criteria": [
		"CLI only communicates over HTTP/2 w/TLS1.3 using OS-trusted certs",
		"Policies and scan sets are selectable via command flags and documented",
		"CLI surfaces depth/detectability/target risk/operator risk metadata for each invocation and enforces configured risk tolerances",
		"CLI handles OAuth tokens from approved config paths and rejects localhost bindings",
		"Report downloads are saved via signed URLs and require valid tokens"
