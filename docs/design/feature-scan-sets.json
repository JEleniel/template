	"steps": [
		"Define a scan set schema (name, description, enabled pipelines, allowed targets, depth score, detectability rating, target risk tuning, operator risk tolerance, rate limits, evidence retention, randomization seeds)",
		"Expose REST endpoints to list/validate/preview scan sets and accept them via OAuth2-protected API calls",
		"Allow CLI and REST requests to reference sets by name (`--set` or query parameter) and fall back to default policies, sharing their depth, detectability, and risk metadata",
		"Ensure scheduler applies each set's constraints (detectors, throttles, cooldowns) and rejects sets that require unauthorized permissions",
		"Add unit/integration tests and docs showing how to author and secure scan profiles"
	],
	"acceptance_criteria": [
		"Operators can define custom scan sets in config or via authenticated API calls",
		"Each scan set enforces the configured pipelines/modules and rate limits and propagates to scheduler and worker nodes",
		"Selecting a set via CLI `--set` or REST query parameter is equivalent to selecting a policy (default/complete/deep/fast) but tunable, and its depth, detectability, target risk, operator risk ratings propagate into scheduler decisions",
		"Set selection requires HTTPS over HTTP/2 + TLS1.3 with OS-trusted certs and valid OAuth tokens",
		"Unauthorized modifiers (e.g., deep pipeline in fast set) are rejected with clear errors"
